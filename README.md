## Welcome to my introduction readme! 👋
### I have a similar, short intro .txt, which I made for Python. Because I could 🤷‍♂️



- 🔭 I’m currently working on upskilling myself, turning a fun pastime (ccoding), into career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 👯 I don't know what I'm looking to collaborate on yet 😅
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with starting a career in software. Where specifically, I'm still figuring out.
- 💬 Ask me about myself, if you need/want more info (within reason!)
- 📫 How to reach me: for now you can use samymacca17@gmail.com, I'll try to keep an eye out 👀 or better yet, two.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've really enjoyed spending my spare time playing Dwarf Fortress since the Steam release!
  - Easily one of the best games I've played. Scratches a deep, innately nerdy itch I seem to have.
